I stumbled across this data set on 8/24/2020 when i was looking at food-related datasets on data.word

There is actually an updated dataset of 3545 ratings on Hans Lienesch's website: https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/

Description: "Hans Lienesch calls himself The Ramen Rater, and (as his website’s banner declares) he’s been “Celebrating the Instant Noodle for 15 Years.” Over that time, he’s amassed a spreadsheet of more than 2,600 ratings"

I wonder if I can combine this data set with an ingredient dataset found here:

and then with Mintel or IRI data on sales volume and product launch data to see changing trends in ramen flavors over the years.

oooh is there a similar data set for boba restaurants?

ooh what if I created a clustering algorithm or recommendation system for ramen. i.e. input what you like and it recommends similar products
